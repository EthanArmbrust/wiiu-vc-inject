# WiiU VC Inject
Linux port of FIX94's WiiU VC injector

Get SNES, GBA and NDS files into WiiU VC.

I have not done extensive testing on this linux port so there is a good chance something doesn't work right, but for now it just works.

# Usage
`./injector /path/to/rom`

Download yourself a copy of this repository.  
Edit the "ip.txt" in "bin" to the IP of your WiiU.  
Execute the Kernel Exploit and install TCPGecko on your WiiU.  
Start your SNES/GBA/NDS VC game, tap the gamepad touch screen to open the VC menu and run the command shown at the top.
Select reset game in the VC Menu and if everything went well you are now in your game of choice! 

# Manual Compiling
Run build.sh to compile with gcc
